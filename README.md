Introduction
Credit card fraud is a significant problem for financial institutions and consumers alike. Traditional rule-based fraud detection systems can be rigid and often fail to identify new fraud patterns. Machine learning offers a powerful alternative, and this project demonstrates the use of Isolation Forest, an unsupervised learning algorithm, to identify anomalous (potentially fraudulent) transactions in a credit card transaction dataset. Isolation Forest is particularly effective for anomaly detection due to its ability to isolate outliers rather than profile normal data points.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the "Credit Card Fraud Detection" dataset from Kaggle. It contains anonymized credit card transactions, where each row represents a transaction and includes numerical features (V1 to V28) obtained via PCA transformation, along with Time, Amount, and Class (0 for legitimate, 1 for fraudulent).

Dataset Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud

Methodology
This project follows these key steps:

Data Loading and Exploration: Load the dataset and perform initial exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand its structure, distributions, and identify any imbalances.
Data Preprocessing: Handle any missing values, scale numerical features (if necessary), and address the severe class imbalance inherent in fraud detection datasets. Techniques like undersampling or oversampling (though not the primary focus for Isolation Forest in its purest form) might be considered or the algorithm's inherent handling of imbalance explored.
Model Training (Isolation Forest): The Isolation Forest model is trained on the preprocessed data. Since Isolation Forest is an unsupervised algorithm, it learns to identify anomalies without explicit labels during training.
Anomaly Detection: Once trained, the model predicts anomaly scores for each transaction. Transactions with lower anomaly scores are considered more likely to be fraudulent.
Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics for imbalanced datasets, such as precision, recall, F1-score, and the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve.
Requirements
To run this project, you'll need the following Python libraries:

* numpy

pandas
scikit-learn
matplotlib
seaborn
Installation
Clone the repository:
Bash

git clone https://github.com/your-username/Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-Using-Isolation-Forest.git
cd Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-Using-Isolation-Forest
Create a virtual environment (recommended):
Bash

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install the required packages:
Bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
(You'll need to create a requirements.txt file containing the libraries listed under "Requirements" if it's not already present.)
Usage
Download the dataset: Download the creditcard.csv file from the Kaggle link provided in the Dataset section and place it in the root directory of this project.
Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script:
Bash

jupyter notebook
or
Bash

python your_script_name.py # If you have a standalone Python script
The main logic for data loading, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation will be within the notebook or script.
Results
The results section will typically include:

Performance Metrics: Precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC AUC for the Isolation Forest model on the test set.
Confusion Matrix: A visualization of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.
Anomaly Scores Distribution: Histograms or plots showing the distribution of anomaly scores for legitimate and fraudulent transactions.
Discussion: Interpretation of the results, highlighting the model's strengths and weaknesses in detecting fraud.
